When the response to a request is received with a successful HTTP status code, by default, the response body will be converted if possible and returned from the request method.

Ignoring the various response handling options available to the builder, these are the steps followed to determine what to return:
1. If a @Content-Type@ header that is JSON compatible is received, convert the response to a @List@ or @Map@ and return it.
2. Convert the response to a string and return it.
