The @RequestBuilder@ also allows the author to build a request gradually. All of the properties that can be set inside of the
DSL-based methods can also be set directly on the object itself.

{code}
RequestBuilder builder = new RequestBuilder()
builder.uri = "http://www.example.com"
builder.accept = "text/html"
def result = builder.get()
{code}
